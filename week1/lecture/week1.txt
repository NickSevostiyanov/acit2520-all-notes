-----------------------------------------------------
node-js setup, 
runtime environments, 
java script review
quiz 1
after midterm:
	group project
-----------------------------------------------------
REPL = Read Execute Print Loop

Pure function = Output is same after tons of input (running code)
Unpure function = Code is dependent (can change)

JIT compilation (just in time compilation)
	Save compiled code (machine code) into .pyc
		(.pyc = python compiled)
	Function called again skips interpreter
		uses .pyc saved output
-----------------------------------------------------
Javascript, python = high level langauge

Installing “python” just installs environment

Runtime has:
	Translator
		(compiler or interpreter)
Environment has:
	API’s 

Java runtime environment (JRE)
	Includes Java Virtual Machine (JVM) (a translator)
		Interpreter
		Compiler (Java C)
	JVM gives access to Java library
		Microphone library API
	
Android uses Java code + JVM translator
	API’s are different
	(Android Runtime Environment)
	
	Orientation API = Android Runtime Environment:
		Boolean if horizontal or not
	
Every programming language needs a Runtime Environment in order to execute (work)
	Runtime (compiler or interpreter) != environment


-------------------------------------------------------
Javascripts runtime environment is Web Browser
Installation is not required

Chrome translator = V8 Engine (Interpreter)
Firefox = Spidermonkey (interpreter)

(Web API’s) ---> (Javascript code) ---> google chrome translator

Web API’s NOT in Javascript
	Provided by Web Browser Environment
		alert.print(“hello world”)

sandbox = security box
	Interacts with Operating System

Javascript = Sandlocked
	Cannot go into OS
	Safe (does not mess with users computer)
	Limits capibilities

Node.js

Browser:
	V8 engine (translator) = Open Source
	Replace Javascript API’s with NODE.JS API’s

Node.js = Environment
	Not a language
	.js = language (javascript)
	
	Environment where Web API replaced with Node.js

Modules covered:

OS = operating system commands/operations
Process = Puts things outside of js into js

const process = require(“process”)
